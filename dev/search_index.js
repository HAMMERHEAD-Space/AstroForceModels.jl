The interaction depends on the surface material properties:\n\nAbsorption: Photons are absorbed, transferring all momentum to the surface\nSpecular reflection: Photons reflect like a mirror, reversing momentum direction  \nDiffuse reflection: Photons scatter in all directions from the surface\n\nThe magnitude of SRP force depends on:\n\nSolar flux: Intensity of solar radiation at the spacecraft's location\nCross-sectional area: Effective area exposed to solar radiation\nSurface properties: Reflectivity, absorptivity, and specularity coefficients\nSun-spacecraft distance: Follows inverse square law with distance\n\nThe basic SRP acceleration is given by:\n\na_srp = -(Ψ/c) * (A/m) * C_R * (s/|s|)\n\nWhere:\n\nΨ is solar flux at spacecraft distance\nc is speed of light  \nA is cross-sectional
